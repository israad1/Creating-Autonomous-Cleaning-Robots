# Creating-Autonomous-Cleaning-Robots
We develop a prototype cleaning robot fleet management system that a company might use for their deployed robots. This project is implemented in C++ and uses modern dev tools, like Git and CMake. For user interaction, we develop a command line interface for users to perform operations with the fleet of robots.
